# Scientific Computing for PDEs

The Finite Element Method parts of the course

If you are interested about lecture notes or problem solvin session notes e-mail responsible teachers or me.

### Teachers

- Ken Mattsson - FDM part
- Murtazo Nazarov - FEM Iterative methods part

### Course Informations

Practical information regarding the course is presented the first lecture. All necessary information can be found in the course pages. This course consists of 4 different parts:

* Well-posedness for Initial-Boundary Value Problems (IBVP).
* Finite difference method for IBVP.
* Finite element method for IBVP.
* Iterative methods for sparse linear equation systems.

The first two parts can be seen as one slightly larger block, where we will have a  *computer laboration* , a  *project* , two *problem solving* sessions and a part examination ( *continuous examination part 1* ). The third and fourth parts (blocks)  will each have a computer laboration and a problem solving session. There will be a second project combining the third and fourth parts. At the end of part four there will be a second examination, testing parts three and four ( *continuous examination part 2* ).

Problem solving and projects are mandatory. Computer laborations and continuous examinations are not mandatory but we strongly recommend to participate. There will be a regular written examination at the end of the course for those not participating in the continuous examinations (or if you fail those).

The two projects are solved in groups of 1-2 students. Ideally 2 persons per group.

### Course material

 The course material consists of lecture notes, computer programs (Matlab or Python), projects and some articles. Everything is uploaded here. The projects, laborations and problem solving sessions can be seen as practice for the continuous examinations.

### Continuous examination

There are two continuous examination held in computer lab (see the schedule). We will test both analys and implementation. The grade is a combination of both parts. We will present the system for grading at the first lecture.
