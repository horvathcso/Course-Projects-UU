# Course Projects

My course project works during my studies at the uppsala university.

The following courses I took, but they are missing from here due to various resons. Mostly because I don't felt like it is interesting to share my work produced there or the sharing of such informations would seem unethical for some reason or too time consuming me to make a subset of the produced work which I am comfortable sharing.

- Applied FEM ([description](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD056)) 2022/23 Period 2
  - _(reson of missing: Course is built around one large project for which the report was created in pair, so the main thing I could share is not only my work and I didn´t asked for permission to publish it)_   
- Computer Assisted Image Analysis I ([description](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD396)) 2022/23 Period 2
  - _(reson of missing: All the work were done in large group, so the work is not only my own, so I don´t feel confident sharing it publically)_
- Data Engineering I 7.5 credit ([description](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD069)) 2022/23 Period 3
  - _(reson of missing: project were made in a team and individual assignemnmts were executed on cloud, so for there I have nothing which makes sense to share)_
- IoT ([description](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DT094)) 2022/23 Period 4
  - _(reson of missing: projects were made and presented as a team)_
