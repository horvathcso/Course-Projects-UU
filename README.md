# Course Projects

My course project works during my studies at the uppsala university.

The following courses I took, but they are missing from here due to various resons. Mostly because I don't felt like it is interesting to share my work produced there or the sharing of such informations would seem unethical for some reason or too time consuming me to make a subset of the produced work which I am comfortable sharing.

- Applied FEM ([description](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD056)) 2022/23 Period 2 _(reson of missing: main project was a collaborative effort, so the work is not purely my own)_   
- Computer Assisted Image Analysis I ([description](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD396)) 2022/23 Period 2 _(reson of missing: main project was a collaborative effort, so the work is not purely my own)_
- Data Engineering I 7.5 credit ([description](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD069)) 2022/23 Period 3 _(reson of missing: main project was a collaborative effort, so the work is not purely my own, individual part is not interesting to share)_
- IoT ([description](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DT094)) 2022/23 Period 4 
- Modelling Compex Systems ([description](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1MA256)) _(reson of missing: main project was a collaborative effort, so the work is not purely my own)_
