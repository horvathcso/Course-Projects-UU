# Course Projects

My course project works during my studies at the uppsala university.

The following courses I took, but they are missing from here due to various resons. Mostly because I don't felt like it is interesting to share my work produced there or the sharing of such informations would seem unethical for some reason or too time consuming me to make a subset of the produced work which I am comfortable sharing.
