[Course informations](https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD722)

### The main teacher for the course were:

- Sven-Erik Ekstr√∂m
- Tom Smedsaas

### Course structure:

The examination of the course (5hp) is done in two parts:

* 2hp: 4 mandatory assignments (MA1, MA2, MA3, MA4) Grade U/G Examinations: orally during lessons and thereafter upload code and answers to Studium.
* 3hp: 1 written exam (in exam hall or computer lab, yet to be decided) Grade U/3/4/5 and a voluntary assignment (VA) that can "boost" your grade which has to be finished before the written exam to be valid.

All information and course material is contained in pdf:s that describe the assignments. As a complementary resource, videos have been recorded with additional explanations. There is no course book. All these resources can be found in the Modules (M0, M1, M2. M3, M4, and Exam) on the start page of the course here in Studium.

### Exam informations:

The written exam will be held physically in a computer lab or an exam hall (to be decided). It will take place on 28/10 2022.

The exam consists of two parts, A and B. A passing grade on part A is necessary to get a passing grade (3, 4, or 5) in the course (also a passing grade for all MA is necessary). If you wish to get a higher grade than 3, then you should do part B of the exam, and depending on the result you can get a 3, 4, or 5. The voluntary assignment (VA), which has to be done before the deadline 26/10 to be applicable, will boost your grade by one step. If you fail part A, then part B will not be graded.
