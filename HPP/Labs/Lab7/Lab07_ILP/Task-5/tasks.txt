original runetimes:
    f_std tests took   0.701 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   0.788 wall seconds.
    Checking correctness: abs_diff =        0
    OK, result seems correct.


after modification to no number greater than half:
    f_std tests took   0.260 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   0.282 wall seconds.
    Checking correctness: abs_diff =        0
    OK, result seems correct.

The runtimes becomes around 2.5 time faster with numbers only smaller than half

It is still slower than previously the hand maded + optimized version without if statements. 0.198s
