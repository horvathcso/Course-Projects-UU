With loop unrolling and leaving the if statement:
    f_std tests took   0.552 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   0.369 wall seconds.

No opt:
    f_std tests took   2.549 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   1.799 wall seconds.

-O3:
    f_std tests took   0.527 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   0.270 wall seconds.

-O2 -funroll-loops
    f_std tests took   0.509 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   0.371 wall seconds.

-O3 -funroll-loops
    f_std tests took   0.584 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   0.214 wall seconds.

-O3 -funroll-all-loops
    f_std tests took   0.622 wall seconds.
    f_opt tests took   0.246 wall seconds.


Conclusion: this way the compiler can't unroll the original loop. Most likly since it is needed "inteligence" to realize it can be unrolled with leaving out the if
And otherwise the unrolling doesn't make any sence.
