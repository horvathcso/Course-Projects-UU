runtime with unrolling: (-O3)
    Doing 400 iterations with N=232 using apply_stencil function version 1 took   0.752 wall seconds.
    Doing 400 iterations with N=232 using apply_stencil function version 2 took   0.776 wall seconds.

no-opt:
    Doing 400 iterations with N=232 using apply_stencil function version 1 took   2.682 wall seconds.
    Doing 400 iterations with N=232 using apply_stencil function version 2 took   2.653 wall seconds.

So this doesn't made any improvement right now.


After changning constnt to 4
    Doing 400 iterations with N=200 using apply_stencil function version 1 took   0.045 wall seconds.
    Doing 400 iterations with N=200 using apply_stencil function version 2 took   0.051 wall seconds.


In uu linux computers:
c=20
    Doing 400 iterations with N=232 using apply_stencil function version 1 took   1.129 wall seconds.
    Doing 400 iterations with N=232 using apply_stencil function version 2 took   1.051 wall seconds.


c=4
    Doing 400 iterations with N=200 using apply_stencil function version 1 took   0.086 wall seconds.
    Doing 400 iterations with N=200 using apply_stencil function version 2 took   0.085 wall seconds.

c=40
    Doing 400 iterations with N=272 using apply_stencil function version 1 took   2.644 wall seconds.
    Doing 400 iterations with N=272 using apply_stencil function version 2 took   2.596 wall seconds.

So it is skightkly faster in the uu computers
