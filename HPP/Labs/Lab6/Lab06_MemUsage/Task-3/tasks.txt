result with and without restrict by default are the same:
e.g:
transform_std tests took   0.123 wall seconds.
transform_opt tests took   0.125 wall seconds.
Checking correctness: max_abs_diff =        0
OK, result seems correct.


but after changing N' to 20 I can see a significant difference in runetime:
transform_std tests took   0.280 wall seconds.
transform_opt tests took   0.199 wall seconds.
Checking correctness: max_abs_diff =        0
OK, result seems correct.


So the restrict keyword has much more effect with small n and nearly has any effect for large n.
At least with the given optimizations in my own computer architecture.
