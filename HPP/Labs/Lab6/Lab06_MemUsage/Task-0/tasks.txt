Expectations: The ModifyWithStep8 is slower if the data can't fit in the cash, otherwise it should have very similar performance.
    The advantage of the other is it is calling datas stored next to ech other, so it will be loaded into cash in one step since 8 int can fit in it.

Times:
-no opt
slow 8:
    real	0m0,981s
    user	0m0,980s
    sys	0m0,001s


fast:
    real	0m0,903s
    user	0m0,903s
    sys	0m0,001s


_O3
slow 8:
    real	0m0,411s
    user	0m0,407s
    sys	0m0,005s

fast:
    real	0m0,156s
    user	0m0,155s
    sys	0m0,001s

So it is match our expectation.



As we increase m and decrease n it becomes faster the runtime slightly for both case e.g: n=50 around   25% faster for both

And when I changed n 20-> 10 then ther is a significant time improvement in both case:
-O3
real	0m0,003s
user	0m0,001s
sys	0m0,002s
