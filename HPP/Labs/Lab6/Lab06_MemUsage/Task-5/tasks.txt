Outut:
block: 100, N=5000
Checking correctness: max_abs_diff =        0
OK, result seems correct.
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=5000 took   0.208 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=5000 took   0.077 wall seconds.


There is a significant improvement with the original code on my computer.

Some modification:

block size: 200 N=5000
Checking correctness: max_abs_diff =        0
OK, result seems correct.
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=5000 took   0.199 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=5000 took   0.068 wall seconds.


block:50 N=5000
Checking correctness: max_abs_diff =        0
OK, result seems correct.
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=5000 took   0.200 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=5000 took   0.093 wall seconds.

b=250 N=5000
Checking correctness: max_abs_diff =        0
OK, result seems correct.
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=5000 took   0.197 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=5000 took   0.071 wall seconds.


b=500 N=5000
Checking correctness: max_abs_diff =        0
OK, result seems correct.
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=5000 took   0.198 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=5000 took   0.114 wall seconds.



Optimal block size around 50-250. Since 5000 has finite divisor it is hard to test precisely


b=100 N=6000
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=6000 took   0.301 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=6000 took   0.090 wall seconds.

b=150 N=6000
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=6000 took   0.328 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=6000 took   0.086 wall seconds.

b=200 N=6000
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=6000 took   0.304 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=6000 took   0.079 wall seconds.

b=250 N=6000
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=6000 took   0.310 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=6000 took   0.080 wall seconds.

b=300 N=6000
do_transpose_mod_standard 1 times for N=6000 took   0.360 wall seconds.
do_transpose_mod_optimized 1 times for N=6000 took   0.093 wall seconds.

So seemingly the best block size on my computer is around 200-250
