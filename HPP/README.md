# UU - High Performance Programing (2022-23 Period 3)

Repository for my course works and course materials during my MSc in Computational Science in Uppsala University

**folder structure:** The labs can be find in the Lab folder in separat numbered folder. Often the work is inside the unziped given file structure, but the instructions can be found in the main folders.
Assignments are under the Assignment folder in numbered folder with the descriptions and the final versions.

### Course introduction

Computers are getting faster and faster but at the same time it is becoming more and more complicated to get  the processing power that is at our hands. This is especially true for computational problems where we need it to solve larger problems with higher accuracy. As a contradiction, traditional programs can actually run slower on the new computers if not proper care is taken to the programs. The course discusses how you can write code that makes optimal use of your computer, both with serial code optimization and parallelization over multiple cores. The programming language used in the course is C. You will get an introduction to C programming and to the Linux environment with commands and tools. The course consists of the following parts:

- Computer architecture (orientation)
- Introduction to C programming
- Optimization techniques for serial code
- Parallelization using Pthreads (multicore)
- Parallelization using OpenMP (multicore)
- Tools for debugging and performance analysis

The pedagogy in the course is heavily based on hands-on exercises on the computer, i.e, learning by doing. Therefore we only have a small number of lectures but a large number of laboratory tasks using step-by-step instructions. You will work with the tasks on your own pace outside the schedule but you will need to presents and discuss your results in seminars together with other students.  In addition, you have four mandatory group assignments. The assignments are larger programming tasks without detailed instructions on how to solve them. Here you will use what you have learned in the laboratory tasks. Finally, you will also do an individual project where you solve a problem of your own choice, optimize the code serially and parallelize it over multiple cores. The grading is based on both the assignments (40%) and the individual project (60%).

All course material is gathered under modules (in left menu) and the course schedule in TimeEdit. If you need help or get stuck on the labs or the assignments you are welcome to contact any of the teachers. We also have an open lab reserved for the course every Friday at 13-15 in a computer room where you can go and work with the tasks and get help.
